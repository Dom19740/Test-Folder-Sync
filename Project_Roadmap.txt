TODO DONE 1. Command-line argument parsing 
   - Source folder path
   - Replica folder path
   - Log file path
   - Synchronization interval

python folder_sync.py D:\testsync\source D:\testsync\replica D:\testsync\logs 120

TODO DONE 2. Logging setup
   - File logging
   - Console logging

   Step-by-Step Plan
      Configure logging to output to both a file and the console.
      Integrate logging into file operations:

      Log messages for file creation, copying, and removal operations.
      Ensure logging configuration is used throughout the synchronization process:
      Make sure all relevant operations are logged.

TODO 3. File system operations
   - List files and directories in a folder
   - Compare files (using modification time and/or MD5 hash)
   - Copy files and directories
   - Remove files and directories

   Step-by-Step Plan
      Create file_operations.py for the file system operations.
      Implement utility functions for each of the operations listed.

TODO 4. Synchronization logic
   - Identify files/folders to be copied, updated, or removed
   - Perform necessary file system operations
   - Handle errors during synchronization

TODO 5. Periodic execution
   - Set up a timer or scheduler to run synchronization at specified intervals

TODO 6. Main program flow
   - Parse arguments
   - Set up logging
   - Initialize synchronization
   - Start periodic execution

TODO 7. Error handling and edge cases
   - Handle file permission issues
   - Deal with locked files
   - Manage network errors if folders are on different systems

TODO 8. Testing and validation
   - Create test cases for different scenarios
   - Validate synchronization results

1. Command-line argument parsing - STARTED
   - Source folder path
   - Replica folder path
   - Log file path
   - Synchronization interval


TO TEST
python folder_sync.py D:\testsync\source D:\testsync\replica D:\testsync\logs 120

2. Logging setup
   - File logging
   - Console logging

3. File system operations
   - List files and directories in a folder
   - Compare files (using modification time and/or MD5 hash)
   - Copy files and directories
   - Remove files and directories

4. Synchronization logic
   - Identify files/folders to be copied, updated, or removed
   - Perform necessary file system operations
   - Handle errors during synchronization

5. Periodic execution
   - Set up a timer or scheduler to run synchronization at specified intervals

6. Main program flow
   - Parse arguments
   - Set up logging
   - Initialize synchronization
   - Start periodic execution

7. Error handling and edge cases
   - Handle file permission issues
   - Deal with locked files
   - Manage network errors if folders are on different systems

8. Testing and validation
   - Create test cases for different scenarios
   - Validate synchronization results

This breakdown gives us a clear roadmap for implementing the script. Would you like to start working on any specific part, or do you have any questions about this structure?
